# Objective: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the sum, average, and largest number in the list.


# Problem 1: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the sum of all the numbers in the list.

def calculate_sum(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total 
my_list = [100, 101, 300, 410, 560]
result = calculate_sum(my_list)
print("The sum of the list is:", result) 


# Problem 2: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the average of all the numbers in the list.

def calculate_average(numbers):
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    average = total_sum / len(numbers)  
    return average 
my_list = [100, 101, 300, 410, 560]
average_value = calculate_average(my_list)
print("The average of the list is:", average_value) 


# Problem 3: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the largest number in the list.

def find_largest_number(numbers):

    if not numbers:
        return None
    largest = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number > largest:
            largest = number
    return largest
numbers = [100, 101, 300, 410, 560]
largest_number = find_largest_number(numbers)

if largest_number is not None:
    print("The largest number is:", largest_number)
else:
    print("The list is empty.")
